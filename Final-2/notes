1. Defining the network architecture
Network has 3 parts: Input, Mapping and Output.
Convert image to data type SINGLE
Resize input images to input size of network input
subtract the mean of the dataset images from each image

Do you observe any pattern in the architecture of the network? If so, describe it in your own words.

	0. input that holds raw pixel values of the image w=32 h=32 and 3 color channels R,G,B
	1. convolutional layer (a = 0.1, stride =1, padding = 2), shape 3 channel 32 length
	2. max pooling layer (max, size=3,3, stride = 2, pad={0,1,0,1}
	3. relu (elementwise activation function - size of volume unchanged)
	4. conv (a=0.1, stride=1, padd=2)
	5. relu
	6. pool (avg, size=3,3, stide=2, pad={0,1,0,1})
	7. conv
	8. relu
	9. pool (avg, 3x3)
	10. conv
	11. relu
	12. conv
	13. softmaxloss (100 classes)

There is a repeating pattern of a sequence of a convolutional layer, relu layer and a pooling layer.
Our convolutional layer performs the step of creating a stacked filter map over the input. Relu layer is for normalization, we change all negatives to zero. 
Pooling used to downsample the representation of the image, reducing the amount of parameters and 
therefore alsao the computational complexity. 
Moreover, this helps control overfitting. 
Max pooling is used with a stride of 2 and size of {3,3}, 
meaning we take the highest activation and reduce the amount of activations by
almost 89%.
Now the output of the first sequence of conv, relu and pooling layer becomes the input of the next sequence. Because we repeat these steps of stacking layers, 
the image gets filtered more every step and smaller every step. 

Which part of the network has the most parameters and the biggest
size?
The first layer is the biggest layer with a data size of 32 and a data depth of 32. It takes in the most memory with 128 kb.



2. Preprocessing the data
3. Feeding the data into the network and updating the parameters
